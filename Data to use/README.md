## Files here

- `databasenames.csv` is a file with names we want for ultimate dataframe

- There's no file here of the actual starting TB Registry, but I'm using the 230908 update

- `20231218_kiribati TB cases_EM.csv` is large-ish dataframe, one row per TB patient, of the Kiribati TB registry from 1998 to partway through 2023. Names and addresses have been removed since this is a public repository. This is what ends up getting cleaned and the end product can be used for analysis.
